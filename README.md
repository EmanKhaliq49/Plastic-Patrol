Plastic Patrol
AI-Powered Plastic Waste Identification and Disposal Guidance
Plastic pollution is a pressing environmental crisis, largely exacerbated by a lack of public awareness regarding proper waste sorting and disposal. Our innovative AI-powered web application, Plastic Patrol, aims to bridge this knowledge and action gap, empowering everyday users to make informed decisions about recycling and reusing plastic waste.

Project Description
Plastic Patrol is designed to simplify the complex task of identifying plastic types and provide real-time, actionable suggestions for their proper disposal or creative reuse. Unlike traditional recycling apps that rely on barcode scanning or pre-programmed databases, Plastic Patrol offers dynamic, context-aware insights, even for unbranded or irregular plastic items, fostering a more sustainable approach to waste management.

Features
Image Upload: Easily upload photos of plastic items from your phone or computer.

AI-Powered Identification: Utilizes Microsoft's ResNet-50 image classification model (via HuggingFace) to accurately identify the object in the photo.

Context-Aware Guidance: Leverages IBM's Granite Large Language Model (LLM) to generate personalized and conversational responses.

Actionable Suggestions: Provides advice on how to clean and sort items, whether they are commonly recyclable, and creative reuse ideas.

User-Friendly Interface: Simple and intuitive browser-based application, requiring no technical knowledge from the user.

Scalable and Lightweight: Designed for easy deployment in various settings, from individual use to community initiatives.

How It Works
The core of Plastic Patrol lies in its seamless integration of computer vision and natural language generation:

User Upload: A user takes or uploads a photo of a plastic item.

Image Classification: The uploaded image is processed by a Microsoft ResNet-50 model (hosted on HuggingFace), which identifies the object (e.g., "plastic bottle," "plastic container," "wrapper").

LLM Integration: The identified label is then sent to our backend server.

Granite LLM Processing: Our Node.js/Express backend, via a /granite API endpoint, crafts a structured prompt (e.g., "Now respond for this item: plastic bottle") and sends it to IBM's Granite LLM.

Personalized Response: Granite generates a custom, human-like suggestion on how to recycle, reuse, or properly dispose of the identified item, tailored to real-world recycling practices.

User Feedback: The personalized advice is then displayed to the user, empowering them with clear and actionable steps.

Target Audience
Environmentally Conscious Individuals: People eager to reduce their environmental footprint and improve their recycling habits.

Students and Educators: An engaging tool for learning about sustainability and waste management.

Community Recycling Initiatives: Organizations seeking an effective way to educate members and reduce contamination in waste streams.

What Makes This Project Creative and Unique?
Plastic Patrol distinguishes itself through its novel fusion of two powerful AI paradigms:

Dual-Model Approach: It combines the visual understanding of an image classification model with the practical, conversational intelligence of a large language model. This goes beyond simple database lookups, offering dynamic and context-aware insights for a wide variety of items.

Human-like Interaction: The application doesn't just identify; it converses. Granite LLM's natural language capabilities provide advice that feels tailored, educational, and encourages behavior change through an engaging user experience.

Accessibility and Empowerment: By simplifying complex recycling decisions and offering AI guidance, it empowers users to make better environmental choices without needing specialized knowledge.

Scalability and Impact
The lightweight, browser-based architecture ensures Plastic Patrol is highly scalable. It can be easily deployed in various settings, including:

Schools: To educate students on proper waste disposal.

Public Kiosks: As an interactive guide in community centers or public spaces.

Municipal Applications: Integrated into local government apps to raise awareness and improve city-wide recycling efficiency.

By reducing plastic waste contamination at the source and fostering greater public awareness, Plastic Patrol has the potential to significantly contribute to a cleaner, more sustainable planet.
