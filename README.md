# Plastic Patrol ♻️

This repository contains **Plastic Patrol**, an AI-powered web application designed to help everyday users identify plastic types and receive real-time, actionable suggestions for proper disposal or recycling. This project addresses the critical environmental challenge of plastic pollution by bridging the knowledge and action gap in waste sorting practices.

## Features ✨

* **Image Upload:** Users can easily upload photos of plastic items (bottles, containers, wrappers) using their phone or computer. 📸

* **AI-Powered Object Identification:** Utilizes Microsoft's ResNet-50 image classification model (via HuggingFace) to accurately identify the plastic item in the uploaded photo. 🤖

* **Context-Aware Disposal Guidance:** Integrates IBM's Granite Large Language Model (LLM) to generate personalized responses with sustainable suggestions. 💡

* **Actionable Advice:** Provides practical guidance on how to clean, sort, recycle, or creatively reuse identified plastic items. ✅

* **Conversational Experience:** Offers human-like AI guidance that feels tailored and educational, making the recycling decision-making process intuitive and engaging. 💬

* **Browser-Based & Scalable:** A lightweight web application designed for accessibility and easy deployment in various environments, including schools, public kiosks, and municipal apps. 🌐

## How to Run 🚀

Plastic Patrol is a browser-based web application. Users interact with it through a simple upload interface.

1.  **Access the Application:** Navigate to the hosted URL of the Plastic Patrol web application in your browser. (Since this is a conceptual README, a specific URL would be provided upon deployment).

2.  **Upload a Photo:** On the application's interface, select the option to upload a photo of a plastic item from your device.

3.  **Receive Guidance:** The application will process your image using its AI pipeline and display personalized disposal or reuse suggestions.

4.  **Follow Suggestions:** Implement the advice provided to make informed decisions about your plastic waste.

## Project Structure 📁

The Plastic Patrol system is built with a dual-component architecture, leveraging both front-end web technologies and a robust AI-powered backend.

* **Frontend (Web Application):** This includes the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that provide the user interface for image uploads and displaying AI-generated suggestions. 💻

* **Backend Server (Node.js/Express):** Handles API requests, orchestrates the AI pipeline, and communicates with external AI models. ☁️

    * `/granite` API endpoint: Custom endpoint for interfacing with the IBM Granite LLM. 🔗

* **AI Models:** 🧠

    * Microsoft's ResNet-50 (via HuggingFace): Used for image classification. 🖼️

    * IBM's Granite LLM: Used for natural language generation of disposal suggestions. 🗣️

## How it Works ⚙️

The core functionality of Plastic Patrol relies on a seamless integration of computer vision and natural language generation:

* **Image Upload:** A user uploads a photo of a plastic item to the web application. 📤

* **Image Classification (ResNet-50):** The uploaded image is sent to the backend. The backend then uses Microsoft's ResNet-50 image classification model (accessed via HuggingFace) to identify the object in the photo. This process returns a label (e.g., "plastic bottle," "plastic container"). 🏷️

* **Label to LLM (IBM Granite):** The identified label is then passed to the IBM Granite Large Language Model. A structured prompt, such as `"Now respond for this item: plastic bottle"`, is constructed and sent to Granite via IBM's API through our custom `/granite` API endpoint built with Node.js and Express. ➡️

* **Suggestion Generation:** Granite's language understanding capabilities process the prompt and generate a personalized, creative, and responsible suggestion on how to recycle, reuse, or properly dispose of the identified item, tailored to real-world recycling practices. 📝

* **Display to User:** The generated advice is sent back to the frontend and displayed to the user in a natural, conversational manner. 🧑‍💻

## Target Audience 🎯

* **Environmentally Conscious Individuals:** People eager to reduce their environmental footprint and improve their recycling habits. 🌱

* **Students and Educators:** An engaging tool for learning about sustainability and waste management. 📚

* **Community Recycling Initiatives:** Organizations seeking an effective way to educate members and reduce contamination in waste streams. 🏘️

## What Makes This Project Creative and Unique? 🌟

Plastic Patrol distinguishes itself through its novel fusion of two powerful AI paradigms:

* **Dual-Model Approach:** It combines the visual understanding of an image classification model with the practical, conversational intelligence of a large language model. This goes beyond simple database lookups, offering dynamic and context-aware insights for a wide variety of items. 🧩

* **Human-like Interaction:** The application doesn't just identify; it converses. Granite LLM's natural language capabilities provide advice that feels tailored, educational, and encourages behavior change through an engaging user experience. 🤗

* **Accessibility and Empowerment:** By simplifying complex recycling decisions and offering AI guidance, it empowers users to make better environmental choices without needing specialized knowledge. 💪

## Scalability and Impact 📈

The lightweight, browser-based architecture ensures Plastic Patrol is highly scalable. It can be easily deployed in various settings, including:

* **Schools:** To educate students on proper waste disposal. 🏫

* **Public Kiosks:** As an interactive guide in community centers or public spaces. 📍

* **Municipal Applications:** Integrated into local government apps to raise awareness and improve city-wide recycling efficiency. 🏙️

By reducing plastic waste contamination at the source and fostering greater public awareness, Plastic Patrol has the potential to significantly contribute to a cleaner, more sustainable planet. 🌍
